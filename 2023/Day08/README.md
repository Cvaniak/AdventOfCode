## Solve Spoiler Part 2

Good thing to notice is that:

- There is same number of starting and ending points.
- That starting and ending points can jump to the same set of nodes.

Good thigs to hope:

- that starting node will always go to the same ending point
- That the cycle will be constant

You can find that cycle goes thrue the same number of nodes and all
but after all this task was done with little hope that input is prepared.
